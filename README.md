Our experiment is done with Python3.11. 
### Requirements
- pytorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- torchattacks https://github.com/Harry24k/adversarial-attacks-pytorch
- robustbench https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench


Results for MNIST in Table 2 to Table 4 can be generated by running  ```python experiment_MNIST_zoutendijk.py```.<br>
Results for CIFAR10 in Table 5 to Table 7 can be generated by running  ```python experiment_Cifar10_zoutendijk.py```.<br>
Results for ImageNet in Table 8 to Table 10 can be generated by running  ```python experiment_ImageNet_zoutendijk.py```.<br>
Running results will be stored in ```./result```

Only models for MNIST are in the repository. Models for CIFAR and ImageNet will be downloaded automatically by robustbench package. MNIST and CIFAR datasets would also be downloaded automatically and the images used for ImageNet(ILSVRC2012) are the first 1000 in validation set. <br>
